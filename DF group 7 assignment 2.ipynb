    "The goal of this assignment is to analyze a .pcap file containing all the packets that were sent during a DOS/DDOS attack. We are doing this to find out more detailed information about what a DOS/DDOS attack actually is, what the general patterns are and how to analyze the attack. We all do not have detailed previous knowledge about DOS/DDOS attacks and are interested to learn more about it. This hands-on session on DOS/DDOS allows us to dissect the typical packets that constitute such attacks and give us an in-sight on how they work. It will help us to identify and investigate DOS/DDOS attacks in the future."
